  abstract = {The ability to derive a whole-genome map of transcription-factor binding sites (TFBS) is crucial for elucidating gene regulatory networks. Herein, we describe a robust approach that couples chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with the paired-end ditag (PET) sequencing strategy for unbiased and precise global localization of TFBS. We have applied this strategy to map p53 targets in the human genome. From a saturated sampling of over half a million PET sequences, we characterized 65,572 unique p53 ChIP DNA fragments and established overlapping PET clusters as a readout to define p53 binding loci with remarkable specificity. Based on this information, we refined the consensus p53 binding motif, identified at least 542 binding loci with high confidence, discovered 98 previously unidentified p53 target genes that were implicated in novel aspects of p53 functions, and showed their clinical relevance to p53-dependent tumorigenesis in primary cancer samples.},

Body shape and organ development, and their integration into a functional organism all depend on the precise expression of genes in space and time. The orchestration of transcription relies mostly on surrounding control sequences such as enhancers, millions of which form complex regulatory landscapes in the non-coding genome. Recent research shows that high-order chromosome structures make an important contribution to enhancer functionality by triggering their physical interactions with target genes.},

The technology relies on the original and, in hindsight, remarkably simple idea that digestion and religation of fixed chromatin in cells, followed by the quantification of ligation junctions, allows for the determination of DNA contact frequencies and insight into chromosome topology. Here we evaluate and compare the current 3C-based methods (including 4C [chromosome conformation capture-on-chip], 5C [chromosome conformation capture carbon copy], HiC, and ChIA-PET), summarize their contribution to our current understanding of genome structure, and discuss how shape influences genome function.},

  abstract = {Large-scale epigenomic projects have mapped hundreds of thousands of potential regulatory sites in the human genome, but only a small proportion of these elements are proximal to transcription start sites. It is believed that the majority of these sequences are remote promoter-activating genomic sites scattered within several hundreds of kilobases from their cognate promoters and referred to as enhancers. It is still unclear what principles, aside from relative closeness in the linear genome, determine which promoter(s) is controlled by a given enhancer; however, this understanding is of great fundamental and clinical relevance. In recent years, C-methods (chromosome conformation capture-based methods) have become a powerful tool for the identification of enhancer-promoter spatial contacts that, in most cases, reflect their functional link. Here, we describe a new hybridisation-based promoter Capture-C protocol that makes use of biotinylated dsDNA probes generated by PCR from a custom pool of long oligonucleotides. The described protocol allows high-resolution promoter interactome description, providing a flexible and cost-effective alternative to the existing promoter Capture-C modifications. Based on the obtained data, we propose several tips on probe design that could potentially improve the results of future experiments.},

  abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture (3C) provides an adaptable tool for studying diverse biological questions. Current 3C methods generally provide either low-resolution interaction profiles across the entire genome, or high-resolution interaction profiles at limited numbers of loci. Due to technical limitations, generation of reproducible high-resolution interaction profiles has not been achieved at genome-wide scale. Here, to overcome this barrier, we systematically test each step of 3C and report two improvements over current methods. We show that up to 30\% of reporter events generated using the popular in situ 3C method arise from ligations between two individual nuclei, but this noise can be almost entirely eliminated by isolating intact nuclei after ligation. Using Nuclear-Titrated Capture-C, we generate reproducible high-resolution genome-wide 3C interaction profiles by targeting 8055 gene promoters in erythroid cells. By pairing high-resolution 3C interaction calls with nascent gene expression we interrogate the role of promoter hubs and super-enhancers in gene regulation.},
