  abstract = {The absence of an intromittent organ (IO) in most species ({$>$}97\%) of birds is an enigma: birds are the only terrestrial vertebrates in which insemination typically occurs without the use of an IO. In an earlier review, we evaluated six hypotheses to explain the loss of IOs among birds. We found some support for the influence of sperm competition and female choice, but other hypotheses (e.g. avoidance of sexually transmitted disease) could not be tested because of a lack of empirical data. Weso\l owski (1999, J. Avian Biol. 30: 483\textendash 485) has criticised our female choice and sexually transmitted disease hypotheses as implausible and insufficient to explain the loss of the IO in birds. Instead, he proposes that IOs were lost to minimise the risk of predation (by shortening duration of copulation) and/or to increase the efficiency of sperm transfer. Here we respond to Weso\l owski's (1999) criticisms and test his efficient copulation (EC) hypothesis with data on the duration of copulation in 243 species. Contrary to expectations from the EC hypothesis, copulation durations did not differ significantly between species with and without an IO. Thus we can reject the EC hypothesis as an explanation for the loss of IOs in birds.},

  abstract = {Sperm size varies enormously among species, but the reasons for this variation remain obscure. Since it has been suggested that swimming velocity increases with sperm length, earlier studies proposed longer (and therefore faster) sperm are advantageous under conditions of intense sperm competition. Nonetheless, previous work has been equivocal, perhaps because the intensity of sperm competition was measured indirectly. DNA profiling now provides a more direct measure of the number of offspring sired by extrapair males, and thus a more direct method of assessing the potential for sperm competition. Using a sample of 21 species of passerine birds for which DNA profiling data were available, we found a positive relation between sperm length and the degree of extrapair paternity. A path analysis, however, revealed that this relationship arises only indirectly through the positive relationship between the rate of extrapair paternity and length of sperm storage tubules (SSTs) in the female. As sperm length is correlated positively with SST length, an increase in the intensity of sperm competition leads to an increase in sperm length only through its effect on SST length. Why females vary SST length with the intensity of sperm competition is not clear, but one possibility is that it increases female control over how sperm are used in fertilization. Males, in turn, may respond on an evolutionary time scale to changes in SST size by increasing sperm length to prevent displacement from rival sperm. Previous theoretical analyses predicting that sperm size should decrease as sperm competition becomes more intense were not supported by our findings. We suggest that future models of sperm-size evolution consider not only the role of sperm competition, but also how female control and manipulation of ejaculates after insemination selects for different sperm morphologies.},

  abstract = {There are several human syndromes which involve defects of the limbs and the M\"ullerian ducts or its derivatives. The hand-foot-genital (HFG) syndrome is an autosomal dominant, fully penetrant disorder that was originally described by Stern et al. Additional reports describing other affected families have also been published. Limb anomalies include short first metacarpals of normal thickness, small distal phalanges of the thumbs, short middle phalanges of the fifth fingers, and fusion or delayed ossification of wrist bones. In the feet, the great toe is shorter due to a short first metatarsal and a small, pointed distal phalanx. Uterine anomalies are common in females with HFG, and typically involve a partially divided (bicornuate) or completely divided (didelphic) uterus, representing defects of M\"ullerian duct fusion. Urinary tract malformations in affected HFG females include a displaced urethral opening and malposition of ureteral orifices in the bladder wall; affected males may have hypospadias (ventrally misplaced urethral opening) of variable severity. We report the identification of a HOXA13 nonsense mutation in a family with hand-foot-genital syndrome. The mutation converts a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the homeodomain to a stop codon, which truncates 20 amino acids from the protein and likely eliminates or greatly reduces the ability of the protein to bind to DNA.},

In addition, comparable organizations are observed at both HoxA and HoxD clusters, which separated through genome duplication in an ancestral invertebrate animal. We propose that this convergent regulatory evolution was triggered by the preexistence of some chromatin architecture, thus facilitating the subsequent recruitment of the appropriate transcription factors. Such regulatory topologies may have both favored and constrained the evolution of pleiotropic developmental loci in vertebrates.},

Thus far, the extent to which genital and limb transcriptional networks also share cis-regulatory elements has remained unexplored. We show that many limb enhancers are retained in snake genomes, suggesting that these elements may function in non-limb tissues. Consistent with this, our analysis of cis-regulatory activity in mice and Anolis lizards reveals that patterns of enhancer activity in embryonic limbs and genitalia overlap heavily. In mice, deletion of HLEB, an enhancer of Tbx4, produces defects in hindlimbs and genitalia, establishing the importance of this limb-genital enhancer for development of these different appendages. Further analyses demonstrate that the HLEB of snakes has lost hindlimb enhancer function while retaining genital activity. Our findings identify roles for Tbx4 in genital development and highlight deep similarities in cis-regulatory activity between limbs and genitalia.},

We know that BMP signaling is important for different processes during mammalian development. In mouse preimplantation embryos, BMP signaling has been shown to play a role in the differentiation into extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE) and primitive endoderm (PE). In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) supplementation on human preimplantation embryos cultured in vitro. The BMP4 treatment impaired human blastocyst formation. No differences in the expression of the early lineage markers NANOG, CDX2, GATA3, and GATA6 were found between BMP4-treated embryos and controls. Instead, BMP4 supplementation triggered apoptosis in the human blastocyst. We focused on P53, which is known to play a major role in the apoptosis. In BMP4-treated embryos, the P53 responsive gene expression was not altered; however, the P53 deacetylase SIRT1 was downregulated and acetylated P53 was increased in mitochondria. Altogether, our findings suggest that BMP4 plays a role in the apoptosis during human preimplantation development.},

  abstract = {Vertebrates have four clusters of Hox genes (HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD). A variety of expression and mutation studies indicate that posterior members of the HoxA and HoxD clusters play an important role in vertebrate limb development. In humans, mutations in HOXD13 have been associated with type II syndactyly or synpolydactyly, and, in HOXA13, with hand-foot-genital syndrome. We have investigated two unrelated children with a previously unreported pattern of severe developmental defects on the anterior-posterior (a-p) limb axis and in the genitalia, consisting of a single bone in the zeugopod, either monodactyly or oligodactyly in the autopod of all four limbs, and penoscrotal hypoplasia. Both children are heterozygous for a deletion that eliminates at least eight (HOXD3-HOXD13) of the nine genes in the HOXD cluster. We propose that the patients' phenotypes are due in part to haploinsufficiency for HOXD-cluster genes. This hypothesis is supported by the expression patterns of these genes in early vertebrate embryos. However, the involvement of additional genes in the region could explain the discordance, in severity, between these human phenotypes and the milder, non-polarized phenotypes present in mice hemizygous for HoxD cluster genes. These cases represent the first reported examples of deficiencies for an entire Hox cluster in vertebrates and suggest that the diploid dose of human HOXD genes is crucial for normal growth and patterning of the limbs along the anterior-posterior axis.},

  abstract = {Homeobox-containing genes play an important role in patterning processes that occur during embryogenesis. Programmed cell death is a key process during pattern formation. The mechanisms by which programmed cell death is spatially regulated are not well characterized. Msx1 and Msx2 are two closely related homeobox-containing genes that are expressed at sites where cellular proliferation and programmed cell death occur, including the developing limb and the cephalic neural crest. Tissue interactions are necessary for the maintenance of Msx1 and Msx2 expression and programmed cell death. It has been demonstrated that BMP4 can regulate cell death at these same sites as well as induce Msx expression. These observations lead to the hypothesis that Msx2 is a key regulator of cell death in the BMP-mediated pathway. Embryonic stem cell lines will undergo processes typical of early embryogenesis upon aggregation and have recently been shown to provide a model system for programmed cell death. In contrast to ES cells, we see that P19 cells do not undergo pronounced cell death upon aggregation; however, constitutive ectopic Msx2 expression in P19 cells results in a marked increase in apoptosis induced upon aggregation but has no effect when cells are grown as a monolayer. If aggregates are allowed to interact with a substrate, the process of programmed cell death is completely inhibited. Addition of BMP4 to aggregated P19 cells also results in cell death; however, BMP4 does not increase levels of cell death in Msx2-expressing cells. Addition of BMP4 to P19 cells results in an induction of Msx2 transcription consistent with its proposed role in cell death in the embryo. Our data support a model by which BMP4 induces programmed cell death via an Msx2-mediated pathway and provide direct functional evidence that Msx2 expression is a regulator of this process.},

However, genetic analysis in mice has provided only partial information. Using the chick embryo as a model system, we have analyzed possible additional functions of BMP4 during optic cup formation. Here we describe the expression pattern of Bmp4 and Bmp7 and we show that, in contrast to the mouse, the prospective lens placode ectoderm expresses high levels of Bmp4 but no Bmp7. After optic vesicle invagination, Bmp4 is expressed in the prospective dorsal neural retina, where BmprIA, BmprII, and Smad1, components of the BMP4 signal transduction pathway, are also expressed. In toto terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end-labeling analysis shows that the dorsal optic cup is the site of a spatiotemporally restricted apoptosis, which parallels the expression not only of Bmp4 but also of Msx1 and Msx2, genes implicated in BMP4-mediated apoptosis. The use of optic vesicle cultures as well as in ovo local addition of BMP4 and its antagonist Noggin proves that the local activity of BMP4 is responsible for programmed cell death in the dorsal optic cup. In addition, we show that Noggin is able to reduce the rate of cell proliferation in the dorsal part of the optic cup whereas BMP4 increases the number of BrdU-positive cells in retina cultures. These results provide evidence that BMP4 contributes to eye development by promoting cell proliferation and programmed cell death.},
